## Resources
- [Developing Backbone.js
  Applications](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/): An
older but still relevant and thorough book to get up to speed with
Backbone.js
- [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/): Straight from the source,
  doesn't get more informational than that.
- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
