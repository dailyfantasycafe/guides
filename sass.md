# SASS
We use the SASS (indented) style of SASS. It's very similar to CSS and
SCSS, without all the semi-colons and curly brackets. The file extension
is `.sass`. Keeping styles clean and maintainable can be challenging.
Less is more and scrutinize every class or id you put on an element.

## Style
- We use a mobile-first approach to our styles. Which means the base
  styling for any element or class is at the mobile breakpoint, and you
  move up from there.


## Libraries
We use the Thoughtbot libraries exclusively, mainly Bourbon and Neat.
Bourbon is a collection of mixins and helpers and Neat is a lightweight
semantic grid framework. It provides a simple and clean way to build out
the grid layout and makes responsive styles a snap. The admin section of
our sites are using Bitters to setup sane defaults and sprinle in
Refills for any UI elements.
