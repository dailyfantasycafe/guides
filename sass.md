# SASS
We use the SASS (indented) style of SASS. It's very similar to CSS and
SCSS, without all the semi-colons and curly brackets. Keeping styles
clean and maintainable can be challenging. Less is more and scrutinize
every class or id you put on an element.

## Style


## Libraries
We use the Thoughtbot libraries exclusively, mainly Bourbon and
Neat. Bourbon is a collection of mixins and helpers and Neat is a
lightweight semantic grid framework. The admin section of our sites are
using Bitters to setup sane defaults and sprinle in Refills for any UI
elements.
